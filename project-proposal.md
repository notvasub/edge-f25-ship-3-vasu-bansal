## Project Proposal

**Chosen Track:** _Replace this text with your chosen track (Choose‑Your‑Own‑Adventure, Password Manager, or Flashcard Quiz App)._ 

### Description

Describe the program you want to build.  What problem does it solve?  How will the user interact with it?  If you’re writing a choose‑your‑own‑adventure, summarise the theme of your story.  For a password manager, explain how you will secure the data.  For a quiz app, describe the type of flashcards you will use.

### Planned Features

- _List at least three core features you plan to implement across the upcoming ships._
- _For example, for a password manager: registration with a master password, adding passwords, retrieving passwords._
- _For adventure game: loading a story file, branching choices, tracking player state._
- _For quiz app: adding flashcards, running a quiz, tracking scores._

### Stretch Goals

If you have ideas for optional enhancements (e.g. adding color and delays to the adventure game, generating random passwords for the manager, or spaced repetition for the quiz app), list them here.
